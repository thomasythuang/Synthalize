	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-7">
			<p>In today's modern era, synthesizers are widely used by music professionals and casual musicians alike. However, all synthesizers share shortcomings on one area: finding and creating a desired sound. Whether analog or digital, synthesizers all have a "semantic gap" between the language used by the machine and the language used by the producer. While a user may desire a "warm" or "buzzy" sound, synthesizers have no adjustable parameters that can directly produce a similar sound using those adjectives. Many synthesizers do have factory preset settings to attempt to combat this, but they nearly all have nonsensical names such as "DramaQueen" or "Break it Down" that provide miminal help in finding an appropriate synthesizer setting. Because of this problem, it is often difficult, frustrating, and time-consuming to find a desired sound when using a synthesizer.</p>

			<h1>Our Solution</h1>
			<p>To solve that problem, we constructed an interface, Synthalize, that uses crowdsourced semantic data to enable synth patch selection via descriptive words instead of adjusting complicated parameters. Users search for words that describe the type of sound they desire, and when a word is selected, all synth patches matching that word are highlighted.</p>

	<h1>Process/Implementation</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">In creating Synthalize, we performed the following procedure:
			<ol><br>
				<li>Generate 48 synthesized sounds with the Massive synthesizer by Native Instruments. Each sound plays the same melody, but the timbres are different.</li>
				<li>Gather descriptive words for each of those sounds using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Survey takers (~150) were provided 4 of the 48 sounds and asked to describe each of the provided sounds. This resulted in over 600 descriptor results for the synthesized sounds.</li>
				<li>Use the results from Mechanical Turk to generate an even larger list of semantic tags for each sound. The semantic tags contain the original descriptors gathered from Mechanical Turk as well as synonyms for each of those descriptors, taken from the Big Huge Thesaurus API (http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php). This resulted in an overall list of over semantic 1500 tags, many of which describe multiple sounds.</li>
				<li>Construct an interface to act as a synthesizer controller. Each synth patch is displayed with its original name and can be clicked on to play its associated sound. Additionally, the list of semantic tags can be searched with a search box on the left side of the interface. When a semantic tag is selected, it highlights each of the synthesizer patches that it is linked to.</li>
				<li>Tools and resources used to construct Synthalize included Massive (synthesizer), Node.js and AngularJS (creating a web application), and Heroku (hosting the web app).</li>

	<h1>Testing and Results</h1>
	<p>Test subjects were asked to perform one of two versions of the same task.  Subjects were to select two sounds of our 48 that might find in an orchestra and then one sound they might find in a science fiction action film.  In the first version, subjects were not allowed to use the tag search functinoaltiy of the synthesizer, simulating the experience of using conventional synthesizer interfaces.  In the second version subjects were allowed to use the search functionality.  Subjects were timed on how long it took for them to pick sounds and were asked their satisfaction with their choices.</p>
	<p>Results proved inconclusive given remaining work to be done in developing the synthesizer interface.  During user testing and observation, subjects frequently skipped over using the search function altogether in favor of perusing the synth patch bank and sampling sounds one by one.  This was due to user frustration in receiving no results when searching for tags they felt were related to the task as well as the lack of emphasis by the interface of the importance of search functionality.  Even after reminding subjects about the semantic tag search function, they would often continue to explore the sound patch bank unassisted.  This is due to the bank only possessing only 48 sounds to choose from.  Commercially available synthesizers often have hundreds of factory presets users must sift through to find what they want.  With only 48 sounds displayed all at once (as opposed to the standard drop down menu), searching through synth patches did not require much effort.  By making it too easy for users to sort through all 48 sounds without the search function, the value of the semantic search function was ultimately trivial.</p>

			<h1>Conclusions and Future Work</h1>
			<p>Overall, many of our goals were achieved. We were able conduct successful crowdsourcing through Mechanical Turk, and the majority of testers found their desired sounds faster using the tag search than without it. </p>
			<p>However, the testing revealed that one of the biggest features Synthalize is lacking right now is size and scope. With only 48 static synth patches currently, a situation occurred semi-often in testing where a user would search for a descriptor and not find any results. This is because the relatively low number of synth patches and their descriptors/synonyms simply did not cover all possible tags and words that could describe the timbre of a sound.</p>
			<p>This showed a need for a more dynamic and flexible application. Rather than matching words to prerecorded sounds and displaying those words, the ideal program would instead take a user descriptor and analyze that to adjust a web synthesizerâ€™s (such as Web Audio API) settings instead to create a sound in real time resembling the descriptor.</p>
			<p>Future work would definitely proceed in that direction, and below is a digital rendering of how a future interface would appear:</p>
